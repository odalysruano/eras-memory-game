# Eras Memory Game

## Game Description
This is a game of "Memory", a matching game, where the player wins by turning over all matching pairs on the gameboard before the time is up. The player has 60 seconds to uncover all ten of the matching pairs of the gameboard. If two mismatched cards are turned over then the player has to "pick again". However, when two matching cards are turned over, those cards will remain faceup on the gameboard. Once all matches are found before time runs out, the game is won. If the player loses, then they can reset the game to start over.

The design of the game is inspired by Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour". This is a concert tour where the artist performs music from her 10 albums, or "musical eras". The matching cards in this game represent each of the artist's 10 album covers, and albums that have been re-recorded have been replaced with album cover art from the "Taylor's Version" albums.
